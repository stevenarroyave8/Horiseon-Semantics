# Refactoring-HTML-and-CSS-code
This weeks challenge involved refactoring an existing code that was given to us to help make a website more accessible so that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies.
## About
The purpose of this challenge was to learn how to refactor a starter code to make it more accesible for people with disabilities so no one is at a disadvantage when trying to access any website on the internet. Not only did we refactor the HTML code but we also had to consolidate the CSS to increase the efficiency of it while following the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
